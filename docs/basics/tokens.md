Learn about the different types of native tokens/coins available in Blackfury. {synopsis}

## Native Coins

The two native coin types of Blackfury are **Black** and **Fury**:

- **Black**: Stablecoins that track the price of fiat currencies, and they are named for their fiat counterparts. In the
  early stage of the mainnet launch, it will mainly issue **BlackUSD**, or **USM**, which tracks/pegs the price of $USD.
- **Fury**: Native staking coin that partially absorbs the price volatility of Black. Users stake Fury to validators to
  add blocks of transactions to the blockchain, and earn various fees and rewards. Holders of Fury also can vote on
  proposals and participate in on-chain governance. And Fury is also used for gas consumption for running smart
  contracts on the EVM.

Blackfury uses [Atto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atto-) Fury or `afury` as the base denomination to maintain parity
with Ethereum.

```
1 fury = 1 * 1e18 afury
```

And the base denomination of Black is `uusd`.

```
1 BlackUSD = 1 USM = 1 * 1e6 uusd
```
